\arguments{
\item{dat}{data frame with variables called
vlabel (labels), nx with x=1,2,... (columns with n or descriptives, printed after label),
beta, beta_lci, beta_uci (point estimates and confidence interval to make forests)
optionally beta_format (formatted text along forest, generated from beta if not given)
px with x=1,2,.. (columns with p-value)}

\item{nrows}{number of rows, setting for layout, typically 1}

\item{ncols}{number of columns, setting for layout, typically derived from the data}

\item{nns}{number of n columns, derived from data if not given}

\item{lheights}{lheights: relative height of rows, length is typically 3 (header, data ,footer)}

\item{lwidths}{lwidths: relative width of columns, length correpsonds to columns in forest plus 2 (left and right margin)}

\item{y.at}{position of lines, 1:nrow(dat) by default}

\item{font}{font for variable vlabel, length has to correspond to rows of dat, default is rep(1,nrow(dat))}

\item{arrow}{logical, whether to use arrows if xlim does not include confidence interval limits}

\item{arrow_length}{length of the edges of the arrow head (in inches)}

\item{arrow_angle}{angle from the shaft of the arrow to the edge of the arrow head}

\item{cap_length}{length of the confidence interval cap, 0 if none}

\item{shift_label_col}{inset of labels in the first column, default is 0}

\item{center_label_col}{centering of label in first column}

\item{shift_textbeta_col}{inset of formatted effects (beta_format)}

\item{shift_ymax}{down-shift of maximal y-value, smaller space to top}

\item{shift_ymin}{up-shift of minimal y-value, smaller space to bottom}

\item{xlab}{position of labels for x-axis, derived from beta by default}

\item{xlab_text}{text at the labels, derived from beta by default}

\item{xlim}{limits for x-axis in forest plots, derived from beta by default}

\item{xlab_cex}{size of x-axis labels (not title)}

\item{xlab_line}{position of x-axis label (not title)}

\item{tck}{x-axis tick length}

\item{shift_xaxis}{shift position of x-axis}

\item{xtitle}{x axis title and format,
list with x (xpos), y (ypos), textr and textl (text at the right/left side), cex (text size)}

\item{lwd}{line widths}

\item{pcol}{color if symbols are used, not active}

\item{lscale}{beta given on log scale, use exp to format beta, default is no}

\item{ps}{points for plot, list with pch, cex, and col}

\item{header}{for table, either a character vector or a list with any of
x (vector with xpos), y (single y-position), text (character vector with labels), cex (text size),
the list can be >1 to define more than one header line}

\item{ref}{reference line, list with x (xposition), extend (extension on top), lty (line type), col (line color), lwd (line width)}

\item{bottomline}{lines at the bottom if not NA}

\item{headline}{1 line for header if not NA, 2 lines if 2}

\item{headline_pos}{vector with position of lower and upper headline (if applicable), default c(0,1)}

\item{...}{options passed to ff_ci for formatting the effects (if beta_format not goven)}
